  abstract = {A new approach has been made for the analysis of ionic thermocurrent (ITC)
spectrum. The involvement of different order of kinetics in ITC spectrum depends on the
experimental conditions of polarization and rate of rapid cooling, so the order of kinetics
involved in the ITC spectrum does not represent any specific feature of the system under
investigation. In suggested approach on the basis of generalized equation of ITC
spectrum, Dielectric relaxation parameters, order of kinetics and approximate value of
dipoles per unit volume are evaluated. },
